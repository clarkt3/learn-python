#### Breaking The Flow

```Python

# key point: use machines to do repetitive tasks really fast; know how to break up your code

```

 #### Conditional Logic

 ```Python

    # gist: python programs are just boolean aggregrations with if, elif, and else statements

    # syntax:
    Conditional Keywords:
    if (evaluate something for true or false)
    elif (evaluate something else for true or false)
    else (when all evaluates to false, run else)

    # code:
    is_old = False
    is_licensed = True

    if is_old:
        print('you are old enough to drive!')
    elif is_licensed:
        print('you can drive now!') # output: b/c is_licensed = true
    else:
        print('you are not of age!')

    # code (long-form)
    is_old = False
    is_licensed = False

    if is_old:
        print('you are old enough to drive!')
    elif is_licensed:
        print('you can drive now!')
    else:
        print('you are not of age!') # output: b/c is_old, is_licensed =  False

    # code (short-form)
    if is_old and is_licensed :
        print('you are old enough to drive!')
    else: print('you are not of age!')

    # instructor note:
        elif    # most statements have 1 if and 1 else; elif helps evaluate multiple conditions

        elif: condition     # evaluates another condition after if
        elif: condition     # evaluates another condition after if and elif
 ```
